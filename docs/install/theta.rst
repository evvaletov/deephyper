Theta
******

`Theta <https://www.alcf.anl.gov/theta>`_ is a 11.69 petaflops system based on the second-generation Intel Xeon Phi processor at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF).
It serves as a stepping stone to the ALCF's next leadership-class supercomputer, Aurora.
Theta is a massively parallel, many-core system based on Intel processors and interconnect technology, a new memory search_space,
and a Lustre-based parallel file system, all integrated by Crayâ€™s HPC software stack.

User installation
=================

DeepHyper is already installed in Theta and can be directly loaded as a module as follows.

::

    module load miniconda-3
    conda create -p dh-env --clone base
    conda activate dh-env
    conda install gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64
    pip install deephyper[analytics]

.. note::
    You might put
    ``module load miniconda-3`` in your ``~/.bashrc`` if you want to use
    *DeepHyper* in all new sessions.

Developer installation
======================

1. Load the miniconda module::

    module load miniconda-3

.. note::
    The miniconda module is using the `Intel channel <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-distribution-for-python-with-anaconda>`_ which has optimized wheels using MKL/DNN (available on KNL nodes with Xeon Phi CPU) for some packages.

2. Create a virtual environment for your deephyper installation as a developer::

    conda create -p dh-env --clone base

3. Activate this freshly created virtual environment::

    conda activate dh-env

4. Clone the deephyper repo::

    git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git deephyper_repo/

5. Go to the root directory of the repo::

    cd deephyper_repo/


6. Switch to the develop branch::

    git checkout develop

7. Install the package (with analytics support)::

    pip install -e .['analytics']


8. Install an ipython kernel for analytics support::

    pip install ipykernel

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name deephyper-dev-env --display-name "Python deephyper-dev-env"
